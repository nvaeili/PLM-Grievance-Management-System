# PLM Grievance Management System 

The transition from traditional labor to advanced digital operations has reshaped human history, improving the quality of life. In today's world, computers and digital devices play a pivotal role due to their efficiency and precision. These devices are indispensable tools for students, workers, and the community at large. Educational institutions, in particular, rely on web-based systems to streamline communication between schools and students. However, these systems often lack comprehensive grievance management solutions, leaving students without effective channels to voice their concerns.

This GitHub repository addresses the pressing need for a robust web-based student grievance management system. Student grievances are common, ranging from issues related to treatment, grades, and other inconveniences. Existing methods, like Google Forms, can be unstable and time-consuming for representatives tasked with handling complaints. Often, students do not receive timely updates on the status of their grievances, leading to frustration.

To address these challenges, this repository presents a solutionâ€”a web-based student grievance management system. This system leverages technology to create a seamless process for students to voice their concerns and for educational institutions to efficiently manage and resolve them. It aims to enhance transparency, categorization, and collaboration among students and authorities, ultimately improving the overall academic experience.

In the development of this system, React.js was skillfully employed to create a seamless user interface, complemented by the robust data storage capabilities of Google's Firebase. This dynamic synergy ensures a streamlined grievance submission process for individuals associated with PLM, enhancing user satisfaction and data management efficiency.

This system is a project for Software Engineering subject.
